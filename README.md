VHDL-Codes

This repository contains basic and commonly used VHDL programs along with their corresponding testbenches.
It is designed to help beginners understand digital logic design concepts and learn how to simulate VHDL code using tools like GHDL and GTKWave.

⭐ Features

Clean and simple VHDL codes for fundamental logic gates.

Testbenches included for simulation and waveform analysis.

Beginner-friendly structure and naming convention.

Useful for university labs, digital logic learners, and FPGA beginners.

▶️ How to Run (GHDL + GTKWave)
1. Analyze the design file
ghdl -a and_gate.vhd
2. Analyze the testbench
ghdl -a tb_and_gate.vhd
3. Elaborate
ghdl -e tb_and_gate
4. Run the simulation
ghdl -r tb_and_gate --vcd=and_gate.vcd
5. View waveform
gtkwave and_gate.vcd
